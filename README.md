# final-project-rooibos
This is the final project of team rooibos. We tried to see how the occurrence of gender-specific crimes in China relates to socioeconomic factors. We scraped gender-specific crime data from a 'bot' webpage documenting such incidents and matched most of them to their happening cities. In the meantime, we gather socioeconomic data on these cities, and eventually conduct quantative analyses to arrive at conclusions.

## Web-scraping
The libraries/packages used in this part includes:
- requests version: 2.25.1
